# RoboDog
A project to expand on the capabilities of the Unitree Go1 RoboDog and introduce the ChatGPT API in order to communicate with the dog through our voices.

## Materials
- Unitree Go1 Pro or Go1 Edu
- A seperate monitor
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- HDMI Cord
- USB hub

## Project Dependencies
You're going to need a Virtual Machine, Numpy, and CMake 

- Installing CMake: Go to the RoboDog terminal and type: > sudo apt-get -y install cmake

- Installing NumPy: pip install numpy

## Turning on RoboDog
- Set the dog on its stomach, make sure its stomach is flat on the ground and the legs are down.

- Check the battery on the dog and the controller. Ensure that you see 4 green dots.

- Then, locate the "on" button on the battery, and tap and hold until you hear the dogs fans spinning.

- Wait for it to boot up, It will stand when its fully on.

- Turn on the controller. To turn it on, tap the "on" button, located on the bottom of the controller, and then tap and hold until you hear the controller beeping.

-- This will ensure that the dog is on and ready for whatever comes next. --

## Using the RoboDogs Raspberry Pi
- Have the dog lie down on its chest, like it was when you were turning it on, to do this, press L2 + A, L2 + A, and then L2 + B. This locks the dogs joints and then puts the dog in the dampening state.

- Plug the keyboard and mouse into the USB hub and then plug it into the far right port on the dogs back.

- Plug one end of the HDMI cord into the dogs right port, right under the USBs, and plug the other end into your monitor.

-- This will give you access to the dogs Raspberry Pi, allowing you to run commands and control the dog from your computer. --
