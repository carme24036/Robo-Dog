# RoboDog
A project to expand on the capabilities of the Unitree Go1 RoboDog and introduce the ChatGPT API in order to communicate with the dog through our voices.

## Materials
- Unitree Go1 Pro or Go1 Edu
- A seperate monitor
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- HDMI Cable
- USB hub
- Ethernet cable or wifi

## Project Dependencies
You're going to need a Virtual Machine, Numpy, and CMake 

- Installing CMake: Go to the RoboDog terminal and type: > sudo apt-get -y install cmake

- Installing NumPy: pip install numpy

- PuTTy to remote SSH into the RoboDog

## Turning on RoboDog
- Lay the dog on the floor. Make sure its stomach is flat on the ground and the legs are down.

- Check the battery on the dog and the controller. Ensure that you see 4 green dots on each. If the dog has no battery in it, put one in. 

- Then, locate the "on" button on the battery. Tap it once, then tap and hold until you hear the dog's fans spinning.

- Wait for it to boot up. It will stand when it's fully on.

- Turn on the controller. The button located on the bottom of the controller is the power button. To turn it on, tap and then tap and hold until you hear the controller beep.

- These steps will make sure the dog is prepared to be used. 

## Using the RoboDogs Raspberry Pi
- Have the dog lie down on its chest, like it was when you were turning it on. To do this, press L2 + A twice, and then L2 + B. This locks the dog's joints and then puts the dog in the dampening state.

- Plug the keyboard and mouse into the USB hub and plug that into the far right USB port on the dogs back.

- Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the dogs right port, right under the USB port, and plug the other end into your monitor.

-- This will give you access to the dogs Raspberry Pi, allowing you to run commands and control the dog from your computer. --
